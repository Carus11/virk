## Introduction to SAS VIRK
VIRK is a collection of resources to automate and streamline tasks that are required to prepare an environment for a SAS Viya deployment.
VIRK provides the following types of assistance:

  * Pre-deployment assessment and/or configuration
  * Post-deployment automation
  * Infrastructure templates

## Prerequisites for VIRK
Each item included here in the resource kit will detail its specific pre-requisite and functionality.

For example, a functioning [Ansible Controller](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html) is required for the Ansible playbooks that are included below in the [Pre-installation Playbooks](playbooks/pre-install-playbook) section. A list of the available playbooks is provided.
